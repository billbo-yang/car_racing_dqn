# car_racing_dqn
deep q learning network for the car_racing_v1 environment also found in my github repos

This repository contains work done by contributors to WPI's Graduate Artificial Intelligence class. Namely, we've modified OpenAI Gym's Car Racing environment to have more accurate representations of real world physics, then created a Deep Q-Learning Network to teach a car to find the optimal lap times for a variety of pre-created tracks.
